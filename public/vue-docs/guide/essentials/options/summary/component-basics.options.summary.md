- Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces
- Components can be defined in a dedicated file using the `.vue` extension or as a plain JavaScript object
- Components can be used by importing them in the parent component and registering them with the `components` option
- Components can be globally registered to make them available to all components in an app
- Props allow data to be passed to a component as custom attributes
- Props can be declared in the component's options or using the `defineProps` macro
- Events can be emitted from a child component and listened to in the parent component using `v-on` or `@`
- Slots allow content to be passed to a component and rendered in a specific place using the `<slot>` element
- Dynamic components allow for switching between different components based on a value
- DOM templates have some caveats, such as case insensitivity, explicit closing tags, and element placement restrictions
