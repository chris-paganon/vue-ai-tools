- Vue component instances go through initialization steps and run lifecycle hooks
- The `mounted` hook is used to run code after the component has finished rendering and created the DOM nodes
- Other commonly used hooks include `onUpdated` and `onUnmounted` (or `updated` and `unmounted` for options API)
- Lifecycle hooks are called with the `this` context pointing to the current active instance
- There is a diagram illustrating the instance lifecycle
- Consult the Lifecycle Hooks API reference for more details on all lifecycle hooks and their use cases.
