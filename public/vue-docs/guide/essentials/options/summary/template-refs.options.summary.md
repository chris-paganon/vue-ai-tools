- The `ref` attribute allows direct access to DOM elements or child component instances
- `ref` is a special attribute similar to the `key` attribute
- The resulting ref is exposed on `this.$refs`
- Refs can be accessed after the component is mounted
- Refs inside `v-for` result in an array of corresponding elements
- Function refs can be used to store element references
- `ref` can be used on child components, providing access to the component instance
- The `expose` option can limit access to specific properties and methods of a child component instance
