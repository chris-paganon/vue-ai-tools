- Vue component instances go through initialization steps and run lifecycle hooks
- The `onMounted` hook runs code after the component has finished initial rendering and created DOM nodes
- Other commonly used hooks include `onUpdated` and `onUnmounted` (or `mounted`, `updated`, and `unmounted` in the options API)
- Hooks need to be registered synchronously during component setup
- There is a diagram for the instance lifecycle
- Consult the Lifecycle Hooks API reference for more details on all lifecycle hooks and their use cases.
