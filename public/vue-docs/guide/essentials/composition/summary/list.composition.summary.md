- `v-for` directive is used to render a list of items based on an array
- The syntax for `v-for` is `item in items`, where `items` is the source data array and `item` is an alias for the array element being iterated on
- `v-for` supports an optional second alias for the index of the current item
- `v-for` can also be used to iterate through the properties of an object
- `v-for` can take an integer to repeat the template that many times
- `v-for` can be used with a `<template>` tag to render a block of multiple elements
- `v-for` and `v-if` should not be used on the same element, but can be used together by wrapping `v-for` in a `<template>` tag
- `v-for` can be used on a component, but data needs to be passed to the component using props
- Vue can detect changes to an array when using mutation methods such as `push()`, `pop()`, etc.
- When replacing an array with a new array, Vue efficiently updates the DOM by reusing existing elements
- To display filtered or sorted results, computed properties or methods can be used
