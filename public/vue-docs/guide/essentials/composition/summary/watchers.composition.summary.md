- The page is about using the `watch` function in Vue.js to perform side effects in reaction to state changes.
- It provides a basic example of using `watch` to update the DOM based on the user's input.
- It explains the different types of reactive sources that can be used with `watch`, such as refs, reactive objects, and getter functions.
- It mentions that watching a property of a reactive object requires using a getter function instead of passing the property directly.
- It explains how to create deep watchers that trigger the callback on all nested mutations of a reactive object.
- It mentions the caution of using deep watchers on large data structures due to performance implications.
- It explains how to create eager watchers that execute the callback immediately.
- It introduces the `watchEffect` function as a simplified alternative to `watch` for tracking reactive dependencies.
- It compares `watch` and `watchEffect`, stating that `watch` allows more precise control over when the callback should fire, while `watchEffect` automatically tracks all reactive properties accessed during its synchronous execution.
- It explains how to specify the flush timing of watcher callbacks to access the DOM after Vue has updated it.
- It mentions the automatic stopping of watchers created synchronously inside `setup()` or `<script setup>`, and the need to manually stop watchers created asynchronously to avoid memory leaks.
