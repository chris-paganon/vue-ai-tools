- Computed properties are used for complex logic that includes reactive data
- Computed properties automatically track their reactive dependencies
- Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies
- Methods are an alternative to computed properties, but they are not cached
- Computed properties are getter-only by default, but can be made writable by providing a setter
- Getters in computed properties should be side-effect free and avoid async requests or DOM mutations
- Computed values should be treated as read-only and not mutated
