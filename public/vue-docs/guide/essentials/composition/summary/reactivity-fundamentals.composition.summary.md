- The page explains how to declare reactive state using the `ref()` function in the Composition API
- It shows how to access and mutate the value of a ref using the `.value` property
- The page also explains how to use refs in a component's template and how to mutate a ref directly in event handlers
- It introduces the `<script setup>` syntax as a simplified way to declare reactive state in Single-File Components
- The page explains the concept of deep reactivity and how refs can hold any value type, including nested objects and arrays
- It mentions the use of the `nextTick()` function to wait for DOM updates after mutating reactive state
- The page introduces the `reactive()` function as an alternative way to declare reactive state, making an object itself reactive
- It explains the difference between a reactive object and its original object, and recommends using the proxied versions of reactive state
- The page mentions the limitations of the `reactive()` API, such as its limited value types and the inability to replace the entire object
- It provides additional details about ref unwrapping, including how refs are automatically unwrapped when accessed as properties of reactive objects and caveats when unwrapping in templates
