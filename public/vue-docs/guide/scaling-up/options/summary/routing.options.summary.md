- Routing can be done on the server side or the client side
- In a Single-Page Application (SPA), client-side routing is used for a more responsive user experience
- The official router for Vue.js is the Vue Router library
- If simple routing is needed without a full-featured router library, it can be done using dynamic components and browser APIs like the History API or hashchange events
