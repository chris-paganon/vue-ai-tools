- State management in Vue.js involves managing the reactive state of a component
- State consists of the data, view, and actions of a component
- When multiple components share a common state, it can lead to issues like prop drilling and unmaintainable code
- A solution is to extract the shared state into a global singleton using the `reactive()` function
- The shared state can be imported into multiple components and any changes to the state will update all components automatically
- It is recommended to define methods on the store to centralize the state-mutating logic
- Other reactivity APIs like `ref()` and `computed()` can also be used to create shared reactive state
- Considerations for server-side rendering (SSR) are discussed in the documentation
- Pinia is a state management library recommended for large-scale production applications, providing stronger conventions, integration with Vue DevTools, and SSR support
