- SFC is recommended for SPAs, SSG, and non-trivial frontends
- SFC must be pre-compiled into JavaScript and CSS
- `<style>` tags can be injected during development and extracted into a single CSS file for production
- SFC compiler can be integrated with build tools like Vite or Vue CLI
- SFC promotes loose coupling and composition of components
