- State management in Vue.js involves managing the reactive state of a component
- State consists of the source of truth, the view, and actions
- When multiple components share a common state, it can lead to issues such as prop drilling and unmaintainable code
- A solution is to extract the shared state and manage it in a global singleton
- The `reactive()` function can be used to create a reactive object for shared state
- Methods can be defined on the store object to centralize state-mutating logic
- The store object can be imported into multiple components to share state
- It is recommended to use methods on the store object to mutate state, rather than directly mutating it
- Other reactive state created using `ref()` or `computed()` can also be shared
- Vue's reactivity system is flexible and can be decoupled from the component model
- Considerations for server-side rendering (SSR) are discussed in the documentation
- Pinia is a state management library for Vue.js that provides stronger conventions and additional features
- Pinia is recommended for new applications and offers a simpler API and solid type inference support
