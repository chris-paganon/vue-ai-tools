- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows rendering Vue components into HTML strings on the server
- SSR provides faster time-to-content, unified mental model, and better SEO
- Trade-offs of SSR include development constraints, more involved build setup, and increased server-side load
- SSR can be used when time-to-content is critical for the app
- Static Site Generation (SSG) is an alternative technique for fast websites that generates static HTML files
- Nuxt, Quasar, and Vite SSR are recommended higher-level solutions for SSR in the Vue ecosystem
- SSR-friendly code requires considerations for reactivity on the server, component lifecycle hooks, access to platform-specific APIs, cross-request state pollution, hydration mismatch, custom directives, and teleports
