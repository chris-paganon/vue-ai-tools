- Vue's rendering mechanism is based on the concept of virtual DOM
- Virtual DOM is a programming concept where an ideal representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM
- Vue uses a runtime renderer to create actual DOM nodes from a virtual DOM tree
- The virtual DOM tree can be created using a plain JavaScript object called vnode
- Mounting is the process of creating actual DOM nodes from a virtual DOM tree
- Patching is the process of comparing two virtual DOM trees and applying necessary updates to the actual DOM
- Vue templates are compiled into render functions that return virtual DOM trees
- Templates are easier to use and understand, while render functions provide more flexibility
- Vue's template compiler applies optimizations to improve the performance of the virtual DOM
- Static hoisting optimizes the creation and diffing of static parts of the template
- Patch flags provide information about the type of updates needed for dynamic elements
- Tree flattening reduces the number of nodes that need to be traversed during reconciliation
- These optimizations also improve Vue's SSR Hydration performance.
