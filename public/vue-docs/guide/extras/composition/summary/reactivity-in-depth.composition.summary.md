- Reactivity is a programming paradigm that allows for adjusting to changes in a declarative manner
- Vue's reactivity system is unobtrusive and uses reactive JavaScript objects
- The system tracks dependencies and updates the view when the state changes
- JavaScript does not have built-in reactivity, but it can be achieved using functions and proxies
- Vue uses proxies to intercept property access and trigger reactivity
- The `reactive` function creates a reactive object using a proxy
- The `ref` function creates a reactive reference using getter/setter
- Effects are functions that automatically track their dependencies and re-run when a dependency changes
- Vue provides the `watchEffect` and `computed` functions to create reactive effects
- Debugging reactivity can be done using component debugging hooks, computed debugging, and watcher debugging
- Vue's reactivity system can be integrated with external state systems such as Immer, state machines, and RxJS
- Signals in other frameworks have similar concepts to Vue's refs, but with different API designs
