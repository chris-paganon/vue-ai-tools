- Composition API is a set of APIs for authoring Vue components using imported functions instead of declaring options
- It includes the Reactivity API with functions like `ref()` and `reactive()`
- It includes Lifecycle Hooks with functions like `onMounted()` and `onUnmounted()`
- It includes Dependency Injection with functions like `provide()` and `inject()`
- Composition API allows for better logic reuse and more flexible code organization
- It provides better type inference and a smaller production bundle
- Composition API can be used alongside the Options API in the same component
- Options API will not be deprecated and is still a solid choice for many scenarios
- Class API is no longer recommended in Vue 3
- Composition API provides similar logic composition capabilities as React Hooks, but with some important differences
