- Reactivity Transform is a deprecated experimental feature in Vue.js
- It can be migrated away from using a command line tool or used with the Vue Macros plugin
- Reactivity Transform is Composition-API-specific and requires a build step
- The `$ref()` method is a compile-time macro that treats a variable as a reactive variable
- Reactive variables can be accessed and reassigned like normal variables, but operations are compiled into refs with `.value`
- Other reactivity APIs have `$`-prefixed macro equivalents, such as `$computed` and `$toRef`
- The `$()` macro is used for destructuring reactive objects and plain objects containing refs
- The `$()` macro can also convert existing refs into reactive variables
- There is a compile-time transform for using `defineProps()` with destructuring, called `$()`
- Reactivity can be retained across function boundaries using `$$()` on reactive variables
- `$$()` can be used on destructured props as well
- TypeScript integration is supported and typings are provided for the macros
- The reactivity transform can be explicitly enabled in Vite and Vue CLI configurations
