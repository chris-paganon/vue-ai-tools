- `<Transition>` is a built-in component in Vue.js for applying animations when an element or component is entering and leaving the DOM.
- It can be triggered by conditional rendering, conditional display, dynamic component toggling, or changing the `key` attribute.
- The component supports CSS-based transitions and animations.
- CSS-based transitions use classes like `v-enter-from`, `v-enter-active`, `v-enter-to`, `v-leave-from`, `v-leave-active`, and `v-leave-to`.
- CSS-based animations use classes like `bounce-enter-active`, `bounce-leave-active`, `bounce-enter-from`, and `bounce-leave-to`.
- JavaScript hooks can be used to hook into the transition process and perform custom actions at different stages.
- Transitions can be applied to the initial render of a node using the `appear` prop.
- Transitions can be applied between elements using `v-if` / `v-else` / `v-else-if` statements.
- Transitions can be applied between components using dynamic components and the `is` prop.
- Dynamic transitions can be achieved by using dynamic props for the `name` prop.
