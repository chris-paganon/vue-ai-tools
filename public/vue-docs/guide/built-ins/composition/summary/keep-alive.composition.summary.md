- `<KeepAlive>` is a built-in component in Vue.js
- It allows us to conditionally cache component instances when dynamically switching between multiple components
- The state of the components will be persisted across switches
- We can customize the caching behavior using the `include` and `exclude` props
- We can limit the maximum number of cached instances using the `max` prop
- Cached instances have lifecycle hooks for activation and deactivation
