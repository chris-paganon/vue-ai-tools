- `<Teleport>` is a built-in component in Vue.js
- It allows us to "teleport" a part of a component's template outside of the DOM hierarchy
- It is useful for scenarios like full-screen modals
- The `to` attribute of `<Teleport>` specifies the target DOM node
- `<Teleport>` can be combined with `<Transition>` to create animated modals
- `<Teleport>` does not affect the logical hierarchy of components
- It can be disabled conditionally using the `disabled` prop
- Multiple `<Teleport>` components can mount their content to the same target element
