- `<KeepAlive>` is a built-in component in Vue.js
- It allows us to conditionally cache component instances when dynamically switching between multiple components
- The basic usage involves wrapping the dynamic component with `<KeepAlive>`
- The state of the component will be persisted across switches
- `<KeepAlive>` has `include` and `exclude` props to customize caching behavior
- The maximum number of cached instances can be limited using the `max` prop
- Cached instances have lifecycle hooks `activated` and `deactivated`
