- Vue is designed to be performant for most common use cases without much need for manual optimizations
- Two major aspects of web performance: Page Load Performance and Update Performance
- Picking the right architecture is important for optimal performance
- Profiling options include PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest, Chrome DevTools Performance Panel, and Vue DevTools Extension
- Page load optimizations include choosing the right architecture, bundle size and tree-shaking, and code splitting
- Update optimizations include props stability, v-once, and v-memo
- General optimizations include virtualizing large lists, reducing reactivity overhead for large immutable structures, and avoiding unnecessary component abstractions
