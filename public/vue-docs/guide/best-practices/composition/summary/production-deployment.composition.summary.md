- Development features in Vue.js include warning for errors, props/events validation, reactivity debugging hooks, and Devtools integration
- These features are not needed in production and can impact performance
- When deploying Vue.js without build tools, use the production build files (dist files ending in `.prod.js`)
- When using build tools, ensure that `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`, configure compile time feature flags, and replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` with `"production"`
- Use the app-level error handler in Vue.js to track runtime errors and report them to tracking services like Sentry and Bugsnag.
