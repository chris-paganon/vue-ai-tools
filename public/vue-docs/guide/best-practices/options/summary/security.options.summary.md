- Reporting vulnerabilities is a top concern for Vue.js, email [security@vuejs.org](mailto:security@vuejs.org)
- Never use non-trusted content as component templates
- Vue automatically escapes HTML content and attribute bindings to prevent script injection
- User-provided HTML, URLs, styles, and JavaScript can be potential security risks and should be sanitized or avoided
- Best practices include avoiding unsanitized user-provided content and reviewing dependencies for dangerous patterns
- Backend coordination is important for addressing HTTP security vulnerabilities
- Additional security concerns exist when using server-side rendering (SSR)
