- Component Registration page explains the two ways to register components in Vue.js: global and local
- Global registration is done using the `app.component()` method and makes the component available globally in the Vue application
- Local registration is done using the `components` option and scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only
- Locally registered components are not available in descendant components
- The page also mentions the recommended naming convention for components, which is PascalCase
