- `defineAsyncComponent` is a function in Vue.js
- It is used to load a component from the server only when it is needed
- It accepts a loader function that returns a Promise
- The Promise's `resolve` callback is called when the component definition is retrieved from the server
- `defineAsyncComponent` can be used with the ES module dynamic import syntax
- The resulting component is a wrapper that only calls the loader function when rendered
- Async components can be registered globally or locally
- Async components support loading and error states with advanced options
- Async components can be used with the `<Suspense>` built-in component
