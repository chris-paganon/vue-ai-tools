- Component Registration page explains the two ways to register components in Vue.js: global and local registration
- Global Registration:
  - Components can be registered globally using the `app.component()` method
  - Registered components can be used in the template of any component within the application
- Local Registration:
  - Local registration scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only
  - It makes the dependency relationship more explicit and is more tree-shaking friendly
- The page also mentions component name casing:
  - PascalCase names are used when registering components for easier import and registration in JavaScript
  - PascalCase also helps differentiate Vue components from custom elements
  - Vue supports resolving kebab-case tags to components registered using PascalCase, allowing the use of both `<MyComponent>` and `<my-component>` in the template
