- A "fallthrough attribute" is an attribute or `v-on` event listener that is passed to a component, but is not explicitly declared in the receiving component's props or emits.
- Fallthrough attributes are automatically added to the root element's attributes when a component renders a single root element.
- Fallthrough attributes like `class` and `style` can be merged with existing attributes on the child component's root element.
- Fallthrough `v-on` event listeners are added to the root element of the component and trigger the corresponding method in the parent component.
- Fallthrough attributes are automatically forwarded to nested components if the component renders another component as its root node.
- Attribute inheritance can be disabled by setting `inheritAttrs: false` in the component's options.
- Fallthrough attributes can be accessed directly in template expressions as `$attrs`.
- Fallthrough attributes can be accessed in JavaScript using the `useAttrs()` API in `<script setup>` or as `ctx.attrs` in the `setup()` context.
- Components with multiple root nodes do not have automatic attribute fallthrough behavior and require explicit binding of `$attrs`.
