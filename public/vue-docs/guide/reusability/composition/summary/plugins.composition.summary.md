- Plugins are self-contained code that add app-level functionality to Vue.js
- Plugins can be installed using the `app.use()` method
- Plugins can be defined as objects with an `install()` method or as functions that act as the install function itself
- Common scenarios where plugins are useful include registering global components or directives, making a resource injectable throughout the app, adding global instance properties or methods, and combining multiple functionalities
- Writing a plugin involves creating an object or function with an `install()` method
- Plugins can provide globally available functions by attaching them to `app.config.globalProperties`
- Plugins can also use `app.provide()` to make certain attributes or functions injectable to the plugin's users
- Plugin options can be injected into components using the `inject` function
