- Custom directives allow for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements
- A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component
- The `mounted` hook focuses an input element when it is inserted into the DOM
- Custom directives can be registered using the `directives` option or globally at the app level
- Directive hooks include `created`, `beforeMount`, `mounted`, `beforeUpdate`, `updated`, `beforeUnmount`, and `unmounted`
- Directive hooks receive arguments such as the element, binding, vnode, and prevVnode
- Custom directives can be defined as functions for shorthand syntax
- Multiple values can be passed to a directive using an object literal
- Custom directives applied to components will always apply to the component's root node
